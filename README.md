This is me fooling around with ClojureScript and learning it as quick as I can by just building fun stuff. Yes I know I could have said "Learning Clojure" because that's basically true but I'm only using ClojureScript here.

* Building: `./build`
* Running: `open index.html`
* Watching: `./build watch`
* REPLing: `./build repl`
